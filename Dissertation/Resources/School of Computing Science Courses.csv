Assessment
Examination 80%, Coursework 20%.
The coursework cannot be redone because it is completed as part of a group. The nature of the coursework is such that it takes a significant number of days to produce it and this effort is infeasible for supporting the re-doing of such coursework over the summer. It is impossible to generate an equivalent piece of coursework which replicates the original one because of the follow-up work which was done subsequent to the original submission. Feedback provided to the students after the original coursework would give any student redoing the coursework an unfair advantage. The coursework is linked to another piece of coursework and cannot be completed in isolation.

Students will choose to either undertake a significant user centred design project, or to conduct a significant HCI experiment. The activity will be conducted in pairs, although the final submission will include an individual report. The tutorial sessions will be used for peer-critique, when students will present their progress since the previous week, and get feedback from the rest of the class and the lecturer. The final project report will take the form of a draft paper; the individual report will be a critical and reflective summary of the processes followed, and the use of the feedback provided during the semester.
 
Reassessment will be permitted.

Reassessment
In accordance with the University's Code of Assessment reassessments are normally set for all courses which do not contribute to the honours classifications. For non honours courses, students are offered reassessment in all or any of the components of assessment if the satisfactory (threshold) grade for the overall course is not achieved at the first attempt. This is normally grade D3 for undergraduate students, and grade C3 for postgraduate students. Exceptionally it may not be possible to offer reassessment of some coursework items, in which case the mark achieved at the first attempt will be counted towards the final course grade. Any such exceptions are listed below in this box.
