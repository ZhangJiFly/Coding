Structural Engineering Preliminary Research Project M ENG5087

Academic Session: 2013-14
School: School of Engineering
Credits: 20
Level: Level 5 (SCQF level 11)
Typically Offered: Semester 2
Available to Visiting Students: No

Short Description
Structural Engineering Preliminary Research Project is a 20 credit course running in Semester 2. Each student is required to produce an 8000 word report on an individual research topic related to Structural Engineering. Supervision and guidance will be provided by an academic member of staff, but the exercise will be based largely on independent work by each student.
For those students continuing on the MSc course, this project will act as an initial literature review and information gathering exercise for their dissertation. For those students finishing with a Diploma, this project will provide them with an insight into structural engineering research.
Students may suggest a topic to research but an academic member of staff must agree to supervise it.

Timetable
None

Requirements of Entry
None

Assessment
Based on report submitted.

Vibration ENG5090

Academic Session: 2013-14
School: School of Engineering
Credits: 20
Level: Level 5 (SCQF level 11)
Typically Offered: Semester 2
Available to Visiting Students: Yes

Course Aims
Part 1: This part of the course is aimed at providing students with an understanding of the fundamentals of vibration analysis and introductory acoustics. Theoretical approaches to modelling systems which can be approximated to lumped parameter vibration problems are studied and related to real engineering problems. Vibration of continuous systems is also studied and related to modelling systems with continuous parameters. The nature and measurement of sound is introduced and related to noise legislation in industrial environments.

Part 2: This part of the course is aimed at giving the student an understanding of Experimental Modal Analysis and Finite Element Analysis. It will be shown how these techniques can be used for troubleshooting or as design tools. Where required for modal testing applications, aspects of random vibrations and signal processing will be introduced.

Timetable
4 lectures per week

Assessment
80% Degree examination - 3 hours, 4 questions from 6; 20% Written report
