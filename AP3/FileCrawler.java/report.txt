I believe it works perfectly well with up to 850 threads, it seemed to get upset after that but I felt that was probably a good thing. Im sure it could be broken with some invalid inputs etc, but I am fairly sure that it is giving good reliable output given the correct inputs. I even ran it on my entire home system looking for all .docx files and it seemed to work perfectly. Matched results given for p1, p2, p3, p4 and p5.
