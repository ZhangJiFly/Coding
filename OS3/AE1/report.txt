To the best of my knowledge it works more or less to the required specifications.

Upon testing my code using the given .o files it seems to run fairly well rarely failing to send and never dropping packets at the "hardware" layer, any drops that do occur should happen at the software layer. I believe I have implemented a random exponential backoff when trying to send packets that waits a random number of microseconds in the range of 0 to (2 to the power of the number of tries so far) this seems to work.  On occasion it seems that this causes a Floating point exception but its possible I have inadvertantly fixed this issue as it did not happen in the last few times I ran it for an extended period.

I am sure that is breakable but it seems to fit the specifications.
