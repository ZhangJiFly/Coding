<h1>School Life</h1>

<h2>London Nursery School</h2>
<p>I remember almost nothing about london nursery school, Karen, Siri, Naya and the face of a nameless black kid. But I did take with me a leaving book made for me by the good people called &quot;Amber cat is Searching for Joshua&quot; (who can blame it) nostalgia or what.</p>

<h2>Hatfield Peverel Nursery</h2>
<p>My memories of this consist more or less of playing with paint, that was my main pass-time, nap time oh what a great time that was and getting beaten up by ben and a group of girls well unless my tricycle skills were particularly good that day.</p>

<h2>Hatfield Peverel Infants School</h2>
<p>This was a fun filled time of eating glue and rubbers with Beth Patterson, a broken arm (yes thats right also a tree related injury) with my mum coming in to force me to write with my left hand whilst other people were falling asleep in assembly, but thats mum for you, and last but not least being a little shit as i was friends with Peter, Tony and Tom.</p>

<h2>Hatfield Peverel Junior School</h2>
<p>Well although my memory is a lot clearer for this time I wont bore you with the details. Again mostly spent being a badest ass little shit in school other than our leader Tony Rowe, I stopped being friends with Tom because he was spending too much time with Zoe his girlfriend (lol he was 7!) we didn't speak for a whole year! In year 4 I was put into special english classes because I was behind mostly because I didn't give enough of a shit to try.

<meta name="description" content="In year 5 everything changed, I got my first crush on Rosie Sontag and stupidly told Jack Gibbons and Peter van Aalst. Shortly after Peter told Rosie and my life was plunged into darkness in many ways, first I was told Rosie would never go out with anyone as ugly as me (owch!) she's not even hot. Then I lost all of my friends, except Jack we had a special bond predicated entirely on the book series "Animorphs".

Then Year 6 came along and I was popular again horrah! At some point in the year I was placed next to Rosie by the teacher and we soon became very good friends, despite the fact that when I sat down she thought it would be the worst thing that ever happened to her. I even got asked out 4 times during the year, sadly 3 times by the same girl who is hot but a total slag, but beggars can't be choosers so I went out with her 3 times despite the fact she dumped me after i gave her a heart neckless for valentines days and she gave me maltesers. I was also asked out by Sam Field, well I was actually asked out by Grace Williams for Sam Field, and yet again beggars can't be choosers she was sweet but not a looker. We went out for 2 weeks before i dumped her ass for being annoying, yeah boi!

Despite my 2 girlfriends and my year 5 life, my crush for Rosie lived on, and when it finally came down to the end of my time at Hatfield Peverel  School I had a sleep over Rosie was coming. This had to be the highlight of my life we even played a kissing game, in which I kissed her many times. I found out later that on that day she realised she liked me too, lucky for me it was the last time i ever saw her. She is now a bit of a slag and not very attractive at all.">
