<h1> About Me</h1>

<p><img src="smartday3.png" align="left" hspace="5" />First off I grew up in the country side of essex; swimming, climbing trees (which will come into greater discussion later), throwing rocks that sort of thing. I come from a really rather eccentric family of 3 brothers.</p>

<p> I seem to have a fairly periodically addictive personality, i have had mild obsessions with, Cadbury's chocolate mini-rolls, diet coke, caledonian sparkling water, and a rather more substantial obsession with watching large quantities of television programs in DVD form. I am amazingly apt at doing absolutely nothing without feeling boredom a talent some might say means i waste a large amount of time in fact doing nothing, but i still feel it is a talent rather than a curse.</p>

<p>Now for the slightly more interesting aspect of myself, On the 25th June 2007 3 days after my final GCSE exam, I fell from a 60ft tree obtaining my very first SCI & burst fracture of my T12 vertebra yeah boi! leaving me paralysed, due to damage to my spinal cord at L3. My surgeon informed me (well my dad, I was actually kept in the dark for a while) that I would have to stay for 4 - 6, but booyah to him it took me just 8 weeks (thats right because I am that awesome). On arrival at the Royal National Orthopedic Hospital (who were the only people who didn't either say your too broken or your too young), I could feel pretty much nothing below the waste and had very slight movement of the legs. After coming out of "Spinal Shock" I had far greater movement and feeling, and I can now stand as long as i have something to lean on, and walk with crutches or just a wall.</p>

<p>On the 25th of June 2008 I re-climbed this tree more or less just because I could, OK it was not quite the climb I had planned as most of it was more or less just tugging on rope, which is so not the same. On the other-hand the hardest part of the climb was free climb (but at the bottom of the tree so not that dangerous).</p>

<p>The broken spine left my GCSE summer of love with something more to be desired, not that I didn't actually quite enjoy my time in hospital I got to spend a lot of time in bed watching DVD's result! I got told quite how awesome I was on a fairly daily basis and I got to shout abuse at the nurses all day. It just was not the summer I had planned of sun bathing by the pool, climbing trees, drinking and general merriment. None-the-less come september I was there first day of school, taking my 3 A levels: physics, maths and economics.</p>
